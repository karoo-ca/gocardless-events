    <h3><code>customer_approval_granted</code></h3>

    <p>
        The mandate required additional approval from the customer (e.g. permission from
        a second signatory) and that approval has been granted.
    </p>

    <h3><code>customer_approval_skipped</code></h3>

    <p>
        The mandate originally was believed to require additional approval from the
        customer (e.g. permission from a second signatory) but approval has been skipped
        (for example because the mandate was erroneously marked as needing a second
        signature).

    <h3><code>transferred</code></h3>

    <p>
        The mandate has been transferred to a different bank account either using a bank
        switching service (where it is supported) or with help from GoCardless Support
        when a customer asks to change their bank account (we can make the switch after
        verifying the details). The event will include
        <code>links[previous_customer_bank_account]</code> and
        <code>links[new_customer_bank_account]</code>. When using a bank switching
        service the mandate may have been submitted again depending on how the involved
        banks handled the transfer.

    <h3><code>reinstated</code></h3>

    <p>
        The mandate has become active again after it was cancelled or expired. This can
        be due to the customer's bank wishing to undo a cancellation or expiry notice
        they sent or because the mandate was successfully reinstated via the reinstate
        endpoint.

    <h3><code>replaced</code></h3>

    <p>
        The mandate has been cancelled and replaced by a new mandate (for example
        because the creditor has moved to a new Service User Number). The event will
        include <code>links[new_mandate]</code> with the ID of the new mandate.

                    mandate has been cancelled and replaced by a new one.

    <h3><code>blocked</code></h3>

    <p>
        The mandate has been blocked because the customer's details matched against an
        entry in either our global blocklist or the blocklist populated by you. This
        mandate cannot be unblocked and no payments can be created against it. If you
        still wish to collect payments from this customer you will need to remove their
        details from any blocks you have created and ask them to set up a new mandate.
        If you contacted GoCardless to block the customer's details you will need to
        make a request to unblock them.
