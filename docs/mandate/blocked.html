<h3><code>blocked</code></h3>
<p>
  The mandate has been blocked because the customer's details matched against an
  entry in either our global blocklist or the blocklist populated by you. This
  mandate cannot be unblocked and no payments can be created against it. If you
  still wish to collect payments from this customer you will need to remove
  their details from any blocks you have created and ask them to set up a new
  mandate. If you contacted GoCardless to block the customer's details you will
  need to make a request to unblock them.
