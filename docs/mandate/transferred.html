<h3><code>transferred</code></h3>
<p>
  The mandate has been transferred to a different bank account either using a
  bank switching service (where it is supported) or with help from GoCardless
  Support when a customer asks to change their bank account (we can make the
  switch after verifying the details). The event will include
  <code>links[previous_customer_bank_account]</code> and
  <code>links[new_customer_bank_account]</code>. When using a bank switching
  service the mandate may have been submitted again depending on how the
  involved banks handled the transfer.
