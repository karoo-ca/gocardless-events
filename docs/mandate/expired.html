<h3><code>expired</code></h3>
<p>
  No collection attempts were made against the mandate within the dormancy
  period of your service user number. As a result it has expired and no further
  collections can be taken against it. If you wish to continue taking payments
  from this customer you should request their permission and use the reinstate
  endpoint.

        The mandate is being marked as expired because no payments have been
        collected against it for the dormancy period of your service user
        number. If you have access to the mandate reinstation API endpoint you
        can use this to attempt to set this mandate up again.
