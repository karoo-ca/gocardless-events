  The refund did not reach your customer the funds will be returned to you. The
  <code>details[cause]</code> will be <code>refund_failed</code> and the
  <code>details[origin]</code> will be <code>gocardless</code>.

    It is important to note that the ‘failed' and ‘refund_settled' events are
    not associated. A refund can fail even after it's been settled. If a refund
    fails GoCardless has attempted to refund the customer and has already
    deducted the applicable funds from one of your payouts. The refund has then
    subsequently failed to reach the customer. If this occurs the funds will be
    returned to you.
